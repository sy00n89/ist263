        <h2>Personal Information</h2> 
        <p>
            Outside of work, I love to spend time with my dog back home and my hobbies are drawing, writing, and doing small crafts while watching a movie. One of the most recent TV show I watched was Squid Game 2 and my favorite movie is ‘Gifted’. I have a easy-going personality and these days I’m heavily searching for a summer internship, making my interest focus towards looking for jobs and revising my cover letter constantly.
