                    <h4>1. User Input</h4>
                    <p>
                        The program begins by prompting the user to enter their dog's breed and current location through a simple input form (or in the notebook interface, using <code>input()</code> calls). 
                        The entered breed name is converted to lowercase and stripped of extra whitespace to improve match accuracy when looking it up in the breed database. 
                        Input validation ensures that empty or invalid responses are rejected with a helpful error message, prompting the user to try again.
                        This step lays the foundation for personalized weather recommendations by gathering the two most important user-specific variables: breed (for size and tolerance levels) and geographic location (to determine local weather conditions).

                <article class="step">
                    <h4>2. Check Breed in Database</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the user inputs their dog's breed, the system loads data from a local file named <code>dogbreed_size.txt</code>. 
                        This file contains a mapping of dog breeds to their size categories (e.g., small, medium, large). 
                        The program parses the file line by line, splitting each line at the colon (<code>:</code>) and storing the breed name (converted to lowercase) and size category in a dictionary. 
                        If the breed exists in the dictionary, its corresponding size category is returned. 
                        If not, the user is prompted to try again with a more accurate breed name.

                <article class="step">
                    <h4>3. Fetch Weather Data (API)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The program uses the user's inputted location to first query the <strong>OpenStreetMap Nominatim API</strong> to get the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). 
                        These coordinates are then used to make a second request to the <strong>OpenWeatherMap API</strong>, which returns current weather data such as temperature and descriptive conditions (e.g., "light snow", "clear sky").
                        This data is parsed from the JSON response, and the weather description is analyzed for any extreme conditions such as hurricanes or blizzards.

                <article class="step">
                    <h4>4. Analyze Weather & Breed Suitability</h4>
                    <p>
                        Based on the breed's size category and the current temperature, the system compares the weather conditions against a set of predefined safe temperature ranges. 
                        These ranges are customized by size group: for example, small dogs may only tolerate 39.2–53.6°F. 
                        The system uses conditional logic to determine if the weather is safe, less safe, or dangerous for that specific breed. 
                        If extreme conditions are present (e.g., blizzard, extreme heat), the system flags the weather as unsafe for outdoor walks.

                <article class="step">
                    <h4>5. Generate Walk Recommendation & Display Result</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once the analysis is complete, the program uses HTML rendering (via <code>IPython.display.HTML</code>) to generate dynamic, human-readable output. 
                        This includes a title showing the current weather conditions, a safety message based on the temperature evaluation, and a walk duration recommendation. 
                        If the weather is too extreme, the program fetches and displays a list of alternative <strong>indoor activities</strong> for dogs by scraping data from a blog on Rover.com using <code>BeautifulSoup</code>.
                        All results are shown in the notebook or web interface, making it easy for the user to understand the outcome and take action accordingly.
