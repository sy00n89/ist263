        I am Reese Yoon majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in data analytics and cloud computing. I also have a minor in Psychology, and I’m interested in the intersection of data and user experience. I have programming skills that involve Python, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Solidity and I have proficient skills in using the Microsoft Office Suite with data visualization skills incorporating Tableau. Outside of work, I love to spend time with my dog back home and my hobbies are drawing, writing, and doing small crafts while watching a movie. One of the most recent TV show I watched was Squid Game 2 and my favorite movie is ‘Gifted’. I have a easy-going personality and these days I’m heavily searching for a summer internship, making my interest focus towards looking for jobs and revising my cover letter constantly.
