        <h2>Personal Information</h2> 
        <p>
            Outside of work, I love spending time with my dog back home. My hobbies include drawing, writing, and doing small crafts while watching movies. One of the most recent TV shows I watched was <em>Squid Game 2</em>, and my favorite movie is <em>Gifted</em>. I have an easy-going personality, and these days, I am actively searching for a summer internship, focusing on job hunting and continuously revising my cover letter.
